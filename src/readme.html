<h3>PBR Composer V 1.00 beta (johann@langhofer.net, <a href="https://github.com/androdlang/PBRComposer">GitHub</a>)</h3>
        PBR Composer helps you design and visualize a PBR Material in an efficient way. Parameterizing takes place by dragging and connecting specific nodes from a palette (typically textures, colors and uv-coordinates) to the output node, which represents the PBR Material. A preview panel lets you see all changes in realtime and the corresponding js-sourcecode will be updated as well. The resulting graph  can be downloaded in JSON format for later use. Images can be inserted via preview fileselect dialog, doubleclick and/or Drag&Drop, in latter case the images will be transformed to embedded data-urls so the javascript functions can be reused without dependencies. Different meshes and environment-maps are available to see the material under different geometry and reflective light conditions. <br />
        <br />The idea for realizing PBR Composer was inspired from 
        <ul>
            <li> Node based Shader Editor( http://victhorlopez.github.io/editor/) demoapplication</li>
            <li> Litegl.js(https://github.com/jagenjo/litegl.js) is a library that wraps WebGL to make it more user-friendly.</li>
            <li>Litegraph.js(https://github.com/jagenjo/litegraph.js) is the core library of the project used to create graphs and nodes visually.</li>
        </ul>
All these components were heavily downstripped and modified by the author for integration into the BABYLON.JS Framework (https://www.babylonjs.com/).
